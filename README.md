# Dementia Check
**Thesis title:** Design of a digital self-administered test for the early detection of dementia

**Objective:** The design and development of a mobile self-assessment screening test for the early detection of dementia via the digitalization of the *Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)* and the implementation of a chatbot for *Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD-9Q)* testing

**Programming software:** Android Studio > Flutter > Dart

**App evaluation:** System Usability Scale (SUS)

**Future upgrades:**
- Use of Neural Networks for more accurate digital translation of visuospatial questions
- Include the other two available version of the Greek version of MoCA to avoid user familirization with the test questions and answers
- Link app to database to create personalized user profiles and save user progress and test history
